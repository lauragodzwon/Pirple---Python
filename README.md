# Pirple---Python

In this repository you can find my solutions to Homeworks in Pirple.com Python course.
The codes for sure aren't written in the most Pythonic way as I am only starting to learn.
However - at least all of them are working (you have to start somewhere, right? :)).
That being said I don't recommend copying them, however I would greatly appreciate any comments that will help me to improve them.
Thanks in advance!
